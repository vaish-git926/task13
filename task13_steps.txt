Task 13 – Free Cloud VM Setup and Interaction

Cloud Provider Used:
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) – Compute Engine

Steps Followed:

1. Created a VM instance in GCP Compute Engine.
   - Machine Type: e2-micro (Free Tier eligible)
   - OS: Ubuntu (default image)
   - Firewall: Allowed SSH (TCP 22) and ICMP (ping) traffic.

2. Obtained the public IP of the VM from the GCP console:
   VM External IP = 34.63.127.14

3. From my Kali Linux machine, I pinged the VM public IP:
   Command: ping 34.63.127.14
   Result: Successful (screenshot1 - ping_from_kali_to_vm.png)

4. I connected to the VM via SSH:
   Command: ssh krvyshnav095@34.63.127.14
   Once inside, I ran "ip a" to view the network configuration.
   Result: Displayed the VM’s internal and external interfaces (screenshot2 - ssh_ip_a_on_vm.png)

5. I checked my Kali machine’s public IP using:
   Command (on Kali): curl ifconfig.me
   Result: 106.76.179.168

6. From the VM, I pinged my Kali’s public IP:
   Command: ping 106.76.179.168
   Result: Ping attempt shown (screenshot3 - ping_from_vm_to_kali.png)

7. After testing, I shut down the VM using:
   Command: sudo shutdown now
   Then deleted the instance from GCP to avoid unnecessary usage.
